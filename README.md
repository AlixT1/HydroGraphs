# HydroGraphs
A program built to generate graphs based on 3 input files - observed water flow, modelled water flow and observed rainfall. The observed flow data. Should have three columns - the datetime column, a ML/d per day column and a quality rating. The rainfall data and modelled data should both have columns for datetime, and Mm/d, they can also have a qaulity rating column, but the graphs do not currently take that column into account for any caculations.

The largest flood graph creator function can generate multiple graphs with a single run through, but it currently is unable to handle if the largest flood falls at either 21 days at the beginning of the data set, or 30 days at the end of the data set. It should be a pretty easy fix, because the error only pops up due to the MaskFlood function trying to hide data that doesn't appear in the dataset at all. so putting in a check to see if it falls into that range and changing the minDate or maxDate as approprate should deal with it.
